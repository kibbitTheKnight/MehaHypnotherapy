		<h3>Consultation Process (FREE)</h3>
		<p>
			It can be done over the phone (30 min.)<br>
			Call 407-595-6050<br>
			Or by email : mehahypnotherapy@gmail.com<br><br>

			The Initial Consultation process is:<br>
		<ul>
			<li>We will talk about what you want to achieve and why you want that.</li>

			<li>We will talk about the level of your determination and readiness to create positive change.
			Because when you are ready and willing, the chance for a successful session is much higher than when you are not sure or when you are trying to please someone who wants you to change.</li>

			<li>We will talk about the different modalities and pricing to see what might serve you best based on your individual needs and preference.</li>

			<li>When you are ready to move forward, we will then go over what services you want to sign up. You might choose to try on one session at first or you might prefer the discounted package of three session for optimum result. To create long lasting change is a process, not a quick fix.</li>

			<li>And if you choose the Hypnotherapy modality, we might do a few suggestibility exercises to get a sense of what your style is in responding to the exercises.</li>
