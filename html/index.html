				<h2 style="text-align:center;">Hypnotherapy</h2>
				<p style="text-align:center;">
					Hypnotherapy can be used to change habits, overcome mental blocks and trauma, serve as guidance, etc. The patient is guided to a calm, relaxed state of consciousness. They are not asleep, rather they are aware and fully present in this state. Within this frequency of consciousness, the patient is in a state of suggestability as the ego, or the mind's insecurities, is dropped. As a result, the hypnotherapist is able to guide the patient with little mental resistance. This is especially useful for understanding, getting over mental traumas, weaknesses, or any other struggle that the ego would otherwise not be confortable dealing with.<br><br>

					Everybody undergoes this trance state everyday, like when a car drive feels like a blur, or watching TV and having the time pass quickly. This is a normal state of consciousness that we all slip in and out of. It is during this state that suggestions are easier to take in and incorporate as the ego isn't there to block or reject it. The person is, however, always in full control. In fact, hypnotherapy isn't possible unless the patient willingly agrees to enter the hypnosis state. Using hypnotherapy will open many doors opportunity as you open and understand yourself more.
