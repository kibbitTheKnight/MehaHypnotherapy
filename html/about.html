				I've always loved to explore how our body and mind work for as long as I can remember. I found it very fascinating, mysterious, and magical at the same time.
				And so over the past 15 years, I've been taking on trainings in Health Coaching, Traditional Hypnotherapy, Clinical Hypnotherapy.
				I went on taking further training in Quantum Healing Hypnosis and Energy Work modalities to assist those who are seeking the non-traditional way.<br>
				During the time of running my spa business for over ten years, although I enjoyed working on beautifying my clients,  I found myself enjoyed a lot more in helping them find inner peace and balance. Through many of our conversations, I noticed that a lot of time the root cause of their issues came not just from the choices they made and the lifestyle they had, but it also came from the pattern of their thoughts.
				The saying:" You are what you think" rang true.<br>
				Over the years I've become more passionated about finding ways to create positive change for my clients with a simple process yet effective and yield long lasting result. I have a strong desire to assist others tapping into the power of their Mind that holds the key to their success.
				My mission is to guide and support others on their journey of transformation by changing one thought at a time.<br>
